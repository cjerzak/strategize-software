Description: The 'strategize' package implements methods for learning an optimal or adversarial probability distribution over high-dimensional factors in conjoint (or factorial) experiments. It supports both single-agent (non-adversarial) optimization and adversarial two-player settings, such as multi-stage electoral contexts. Users can estimate the distribution of factor levels that best achieves a chosen objective, optionally under institutional constraints (e.g., two-stage primaries). The package offers a variety of estimation routines, including closed-form solutions for some linear models, gradient-based optimizers for more complex outcome models, and built-in support for inference (via the delta method). It is particularly suitable for exploring and comparing candidate strategies in forced-choice conjoint studies, but is general enough for broader use in high-dimensional policy learning.
