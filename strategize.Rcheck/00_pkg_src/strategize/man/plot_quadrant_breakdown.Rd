\usage{
plot_quadrant_breakdown(
  result,
  type = c("bar", "pie"),
  nMonte = 500,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{result}{Output from \code{\link{strategize}} with \code{adversarial = TRUE}}

\item{type}{Character string specifying the plot type:
\itemize{
  \item \code{"bar"}: Stacked bar chart showing contributions
  \item \code{"pie"}: Pie chart showing proportions
}
Default is \code{"bar"}.}

\item{nMonte}{Integer. Number of Monte Carlo samples for estimation.
Default is 500.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Whether to print progress messages. Default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  \describe{
    \item{weights}{Named vector of four-quadrant weights (sum to 1)}
    \item{contributions}{Named vector of contributions to Q* from each quadrant}
    \item{Q_star}{Total equilibrium vote share}
    \item{plot}{Base R plot (invisible return)}
  }
}
\description{
Decomposes the equilibrium vote share Q* into contributions from four
distinct election scenarios, providing insight into which primary-to-general
election pathways drive the Nash equilibrium outcome.
}
\details{
In adversarial mode, two parties simultaneously optimize their candidate
attribute distributions. Each party's "entrant" candidate (drawn from the
optimized distribution) competes in a primary against a "field" candidate
(drawn from the baseline distribution). The general election outcome
depends on which candidates win their respective primaries, creating
four possible scenarios. This function visualizes the relative importance
of each scenario to the overall equilibrium.


The four scenarios (quadrants) represent different primary election outcomes:
\describe{
  \item{E1: Both Entrants}{Both parties' "entrant" candidates (sampled from
    optimized distributions) win their primaries}
  \item{E2: A Entrant, B Field}{Party A's entrant wins, Party B's field
    candidate (sampled from baseline) wins}
  \item{E3: A Field, B Entrant}{Party A's field wins, Party B's entrant wins}
  \item{E4: Both Field}{Both parties' field candidates win their primaries}
}

The weight of each scenario depends on the primary election probabilities
(kappa values), which in turn depend on the voter model.
}
\section{Interpretation}{

\itemize{
  \item A dominant E1 contribution suggests entrant vs. entrant matchups
    are most important for the equilibrium
  \item Balanced contributions indicate a robust equilibrium across scenarios
  \item Large E4 contribution suggests field candidates often win primaries
}
