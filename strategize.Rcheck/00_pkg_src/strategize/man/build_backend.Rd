\title{Build the environment for \code{strategize}. Creates a conda environment in which
JAX and NumPy are installed. Users may also create such an environment
themselves.}
\usage{
build_backend(conda_env = "strategize_env", conda = "auto")
}
\arguments{
\item{conda_env}{Name of the conda environment in which to place the backends.
Defaults to \code{"strategize_env"}.}

\item{conda}{The path to a conda executable. Using \code{"auto"} allows reticulate
to attempt to automatically find an appropriate conda binary. Defaults to \code{"auto"}.
If creation fails and a conda binary is found on PATH, the function retries with it.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{NULL}. This function is called for its side effects
of creating and configuring a conda environment for \code{strategize}.
This function requires an Internet connection.
You can find a list of conda Python paths via: \code{Sys.which("python")}
