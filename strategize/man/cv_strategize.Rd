\arguments{
\item{Y}{A numeric or binary response vector. If binary (e.g., 0–1), it should 
correspond to forced-choice outcomes (1 if candidate \code{A} is chosen; 0 if 
candidate \code{B} is chosen). If numeric, please see details in 
\code{\link{strategize}} for how outcomes are handled.}

\item{W}{A data frame or matrix representing the randomized conjoint attributes. 
Each column is a factor or character vector indicating attribute levels for a 
particular dimension. Multiple columns can be used if the conjoint has multiple
attributes.}

\item{X}{Optional covariate matrix or data frame for modeling systematic 
heterogeneity. If \code{K > 1}, this is typically required for multi-class or 
cluster-based models. Otherwise, set \code{X = NULL}.}

\item{lambda_seq}{A numeric vector of candidate \eqn{\lambda} values for 
cross-validation. If \code{NULL} and \code{lambda} is also \code{NULL}, 
a sequence of values is automatically generated (e.g., via 
\code{10^seq(-4, 0, length.out = 5) * sd(Y)}).}

\item{lambda}{A single user-specified \eqn{\lambda} value. If provided, 
cross-validation is effectively disabled unless \code{lambda_seq} is also 
supplied.}

\item{folds}{An integer or user-specified partitioning indicating the number of 
cross-validation folds. Defaults to 2. See Details for how data splitting is done.}

\item{varcov_cluster_variable}{An optional clustering variable for robust standard 
errors. For instance, if the data is from multiple respondents, specify respondent 
IDs here for cluster-robust inference (via sandwich estimation). If \code{NULL}, no 
cluster-based variance correction is used.}

\item{competing_group_variable_respondent}{Optional vector for multi-round or 
multi-group setups, indicating which respondent belongs to which group. Used for 
advanced or adversarial designs (e.g., dual-party contexts). If \code{NULL}, 
standard usage is assumed.}

\item{competing_group_variable_candidate}{Similar to 
\code{competing_group_variable_respondent}, but for candidate-level grouping. 
If \code{NULL}, standard usage is assumed.}

\item{competing_group_competition_variable_candidate}{An optional variable for 
specifying which candidate is in competition with which group. Relevant if 
multi-step adversarial frameworks are used.}

\item{pair_id}{An optional vector (same length as \code{Y}) identifying which 
rows (candidate pairs) belong to the same forced choice. For example, if each 
respondent evaluates multiple pairs, this ID ensures correct grouping. 
Required only in certain advanced difference-in-differences or paired analyses.}

\item{respondent_id}{A user-specified ID to denote respondent-level grouping, 
typically used to cluster standard errors or to perform out-of-sample validation 
by respondent. If \code{NULL}, a simple row index is used for splitting.}

\item{respondent_task_id}{Another optional ID for tasks (e.g., each respondent 
might see multiple tasks). Helps in advanced designs. If \code{NULL}, ignored.}

\item{profile_order}{An optional vector capturing the ordering of candidate 
profiles within tasks, if multiple profiles are being shown. Used in difference 
or extended hierarchical modeling.}

\item{p_list}{A list of assignment probabilities for each attribute, if known 
or desired as a baseline. If \code{NULL}, each level is assumed to have 
uniform probability or derived from empirical frequencies in \code{W}.}

\item{slate_list}{An optional list specifying alternative or restricted sets of 
attribute levels. Used when a subset of attributes is feasible or when bounding 
certain strategies in an adversarial design.}

\item{use_optax}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, uses the \pkg{optax} Python library 
(via \pkg{reticulate}) for gradient-based optimization. If \code{FALSE}, uses 
a default gradient-based approach from \pkg{jax}.}

\item{K}{An integer specifying the number of mixture components or clusters if 
\code{X} is used (e.g., for multi-class analysis). Defaults to 1 (no mixture).}

\item{nSGD}{An integer number of iterations for gradient-based training. Defaults 
to 100 but can be increased if convergence has not been reached.}

\item{diff}{Logical indicating whether a difference-based model (e.g., for 
forced-choice or difference-in-outcomes) is used. Defaults to \code{FALSE}, but 
set \code{TRUE} in certain difference-of-utility designs.}

\item{adversarial}{Logical indicating whether to use a two-party or multi-agent 
\emph{adversarial} approach in the optimization. If \code{TRUE}, a min-max 
(zero-sum) formulation is employed. Defaults to \code{FALSE} (single-agent 
or average-case optimization).}

\item{use_regularization}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, penalty-based regularization
is used for the outcome model. Usually set to \code{TRUE} for large designs.
Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{force_gaussian}{Logical indicating whether a Gaussian family
(\code{lm}-style) is forced for the outcome model, even if \code{Y} is binary.
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{temperature}{Optional numeric temperature controlling the smoothness of
Gumbel-Softmax sampling when exploring probability vectors. Smaller values
lead to distributions closer to the argmax. Defaults to \code{NULL}, which
allows internal defaults.}

\item{a_init_sd}{A numeric controlling the random initialization scale for
unconstrained parameters in gradient-based optimization. Defaults to 0.001.
Larger values can help avoid local minima in complex outcome landscapes.}

\item{learning_rate_max}{Base learning rate for gradient-based optimizers.
Defaults to \code{0.001}.}

\item{penalty_type}{A character string specifying the type of penalty for the
\emph{optimal stochastic intervention}, e.g., \code{"KL"}, \code{"L2"},
or \code{"LogMaxProb"}. The default is \code{"KL"}.}

\item{outcome_model_type}{Character string indicating the outcome model to
use, such as \code{"glm"} for generalized linear models or \code{"neural"}
for a neural-network approximation. Defaults to \code{"glm"}.}

\item{compute_se}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, attempts to compute standard errors
using M-estimation or the Delta method. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{conda_env}{A character specifying the name of a Conda environment for
\pkg{reticulate}. Defaults to \code{"strategize_env"}.}

\item{conda_env_required}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, errors if the specified 
Conda environment \code{conda_env} cannot be found. Otherwise tries to fall 
back gracefully.}

\item{conf_level}{The confidence level (between 0 and 1) for interval estimation, 
default 0.90.}

\item{nFolds_glm}{An integer specifying the number of folds in internal 
regression-based cross-validation (if used) for outcome model selection. 
Defaults to 3.}

\item{nMonte_adversarial}{A positive integer specifying the number of Monte Carlo 
draws for the min-max (adversarial) stage, if \code{adversarial = TRUE}. Defaults 
to 5.}

\item{nMonte_Qglm}{An integer specifying the number of Monte Carlo draws 
for evaluating certain integrals in \code{glm}-based approximations, default 100.}

\item{optim_type}{A character describing the optimization routine. Typically 
\code{"default"} uses a standard gradient-based approach; set \code{"tryboth"} 
or \code{"SecondOrder"} for testing or advanced routines.}

  \item{lambda}{The chosen \eqn{\lambda} value from cross-validation (and

}
\description{
Performs cross-validation to select the regularization parameter \eqn{\lambda} 
(and, if desired, other hyperparameters) for the \code{\link{strategize}} function. 
This function splits the data by respondent (or user-specified units), trains
candidate models under a grid of \eqn{\lambda} values, and evaluates out-of-sample
performance, returning the model that maximizes a chosen criterion (e.g., out-of-sample 
expected utility or log-likelihood).
}
\details{
\code{cv_strategize} implements a cross-validation routine for
\code{\link{strategize}}. First, the data is split into \code{folds} parts. 
For each fold, we train candidate outcome models and compute out-of-sample 
performance. The best-performing \eqn{\lambda} is selected. Finally, a 
refit on the full data is done using the chosen hyperparameters, returning 
the results of the final \code{\link{strategize}} call with \eqn{\lambda} set 
to the best value.

The function supports a wide range of conjoints, including forced-choice 
(where \code{diff = TRUE}), multi-cluster outcome modeling (where \eqn{K > 1}), 
and adversarial designs (where \code{adversarial = TRUE}). Regularization for the 
outcome model or for the candidate distribution can be enabled via 
\code{use_regularization} and \code{penalty_type}. Cross-validation is particularly 
helpful when the data is limited or highly dimensional.
