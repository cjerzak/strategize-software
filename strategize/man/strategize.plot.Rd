\arguments{
\item{hypotheticalProbList}{A list of numeric vectors, each corresponding to a set of
hypothetical probabilities to be plotted. These are typically model-based or
derived values.}

\item{SEsList}{A list of numeric vectors of the same structure as
\code{hypotheticalProbList}, containing standard errors for each probability.
Used to plot confidence intervals.}

\item{assignmentProbList}{A list of numeric vectors of "assignment" or
baseline probabilities to be overlaid as vertical ticks on each plot
(depending on \code{ticksType}).}

\item{col.main}{Character. Color for the main title in each subplot.
Default is \code{"black"}.}

\item{zStar}{Numeric. Multiplier for the standard error bars (e.g., 1.96
for approximately 95\\% confidence intervals). Default is \code{1}.}

\item{xlim}{Numeric vector of length 2. The x-axis limits for all subplots.
Defaults to \code{c(0, 1)} if not specified.}

\item{ticksType}{Character. Controls the type of reference ticks added.
\code{"assignmentProbs"}: Vertical ticks drawn at the positions from \code{assignmentProbList} (default).
\code{"zero"}: Vertical ticks drawn at 0.
\code{"none"}: No vertical reference ticks.}

\item{col_vec}{Optional character vector of colors (one per set of probabilities
in \code{hypotheticalProbList}). If \code{NULL}, uses sequential indexing
for color.}

\item{plotNames}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), factor/condition labels
will be placed along the y-axis.}

\item{plotCIs}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), error bars will be drawn
using \code{SEsList}.}

\item{widths_vec, heights_vec}{Currently unused. Reserved for future layout
expansions.}

\item{mainTitle}{Character. An overall title for the plot. Default is
an empty string.}

\item{margins_vec}{Currently unused. Reserved for future layout expansions.}

\item{add}{Logical. If \code{FALSE} (default), a new plot is created. If
\code{TRUE}, points/error bars are added to an existing plot space.}

\item{pch}{Numeric or character. The plotting symbol. Default is \code{20}.}

\item{factor_name_transformer}{Function to transform factor names for display.
Should accept and return a character vector. Default is identity function.}

\item{level_name_transformer}{Function to transform level names for display.
Should accept and return a character vector. Default is identity function.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{NULL}. This function is primarily called for its
side effect: producing a multi-panel base R plot.
}
\description{
This function creates a grid of base R plots to visualize and compare
probabilities (and optionally their confidence intervals) across multiple
hypothetical or assignment scenarios. By default, it arranges the plots
in a 3xN grid, labeling each row according to the factor or condition
being displayed.
}
\details{
\code{strategize.plot} arranges multiple subplots (3 columns by default) in a grid
that depends on the number of elements in \code{assignmentProbList}. Each subplot
will show a factor level or condition on the y-axis, with probabilities along
the x-axis. If confidence intervals are provided (\code{SEsList}), horizontal
error bars around each probability point will be displayed. Additionally, vertical
reference ticks can be added, showing values from \code{assignmentProbList} or zero
depending on \code{ticksType}.
