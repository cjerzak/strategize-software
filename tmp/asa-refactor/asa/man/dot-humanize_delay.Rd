\description{
Not uniform jitter. This models the messy, inefficient pause between
intention and action - the entropy of a tired hand:
\itemize{
  \item Log-normal base: most actions quick, occasional long pauses (thinking)
  \item Micro-stutters: tiny random additions (the tremor of uncertainty)
  \item Fatigue curve: delays drift longer as session ages
  \item Occasional spikes: the pause of a mind changing
}
