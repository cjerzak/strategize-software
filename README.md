# R package for discovering optimal treatment strategies in high-dimensional data. 
Software for implementing optimal stochastic intervention analysis. Current implementation handles text and conjoint data from experiments. Future implementation may also include network, time series, and observational data. 

Package also includes functions for calculating conservative variance estimates for researcher-defined stochastic intervention strategies that are exact (i.e. non-asymptotic).
