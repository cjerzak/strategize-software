# `strategize`: An R package for discovering optimal treatment strategies in high-dimensional data

Software for implementing optimal stochastic intervention analysis. Current implementation handles conjoint data from experiments. Future implementation may also include text, network, and/or time series, with observational data also potentially allowed as well. ABC.

# Installation
The most recent version of `strategize` can be installed directly from the repository using the `devtools` package
```
devtools::install_github("cjerzak/strategize-software/strategize")
```

The package can then be loaded into your R session like so: 
```
library(    strategize   )
```
Package functions can also be assessed like so: `strategize::function_name``.
